I am a first-year M.S. student in Computer Science at **UC San Diego**, advised by Prof. Hao Zhang, and I hold a B.S. from **ShanghaiTech University** advised by Prof. Kewei Tu. My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning Systems**. I am particularly passionate about designing efficient architectures for **Long-Context Modeling** and exploring the frontiers of **World Models** to bridge system efficiency with model capability.

Currently, I focus on scalable training and inference for generative models. I am the lead author of **FlashMHF** (under review), where I proposed a novel Multi-Head FFN architecture backed by IO-aware Triton/CUDA kernels. Additionally, as a core contributor to **FastVideo** in Hao AI Lab, I am working on new model aggregation and optimized kernel implementations to accelerate video generation systems.

Looking ahead, I aim to extend my work on **FlashMHF** to broader LLM backbones and delve deeper into **World Models** within the FastVideo framework. I am also actively exploring retrieval-based methods and **Continual Learning** to solve the challenges of long-context understanding in foundation models.
